## Key Findings:

- **Largest unemployed group by nationality**: **German nationals**  â€” suggesting structural unemployment rather than purely migrant-related factors.
- **Lowest unemployment rate**: **Youth 15â€“24** â€” possibly due to active participation in apprenticeships, vocational programs, or education.
- **Gender gap**: Male unemployment is **1.1Ã— higher** than female â€” may reflect sectoral employment patterns, with men more concentrated in industries facing slowdowns.
- **Aging workforce impact**: Higher unemployment in the 55+ group indicates possible age-related labor market exclusion.
