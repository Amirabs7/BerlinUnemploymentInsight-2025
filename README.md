## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Largest unemployed group by nationality**: German nationals (**5,526**) — suggesting structural unemployment rather than purely migrant-related factors.
- **Lowest unemployment rate**: Youth 15–24 (**801**) — possibly due to active participation in apprenticeships, vocational programs, or education.
- **Gender gap**: Male unemployment is **1.1× higher** than female — may reflect sectoral employment patterns, with men more concentrated in industries facing slowdowns.
- **Aging workforce impact**: Higher unemployment in the 55+ group indicates possible age-related labor market exclusion.
